# Tech Architecture: Developer-First Local Habit Tracker

Based on the product plan, here is the implementation-ready software architecture designed for simplicity, scalability, and an optimal developer experience.

## 1. Tech Stack

To ensure a seamless dual Web + CLI experience with local SQLite storage, we use a single-binary approach.

- **Backend & CLI Engine:** **Go (Golang)**. Go produces incredibly fast, self-contained, cross-platform binaries. It handles both the CLI command execution and the background HTTP server for the dashboard.
- **Database:** **SQLite3** (`mattn/go-sqlite3`). A local, file-based SQL database that requires zero configuration.
- **Frontend:** **React + TypeScript + Vite**. A fast, static Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. Perfect for rapid, developer-focused UI construction (dark mode, glassmorphism).
- **Delivery:** **Go `embed`**. The Vite-built React frontend is compiled into static assets (HTML/JS/CSS) which are embedded directly into the Go binary. The user downloads exactly **one** file.

## 2. Folder Structure

The project is structured as a standard Go monorepo with an embedded frontend.

```

## 3. API Design (REST)

The local API serves the web dashboard and enables the "Habits as Code" capability.

### Routes

- `GET /api/habits` - List all active habits.
- `POST /api/habits` - Create a new habit.
- `GET /api/habits/:id/logs` - Get completion logs for a specific habit.
- `POST /api/logs` - Record an action (Done, Skip, Miss).
- `GET /api/analytics/heatmap` - Fetch aggregated 365-day data for the UI contribution graph.

### Request/Response Example: Logging a Habit

**`POST /api/logs`**

_Request:_

```json
{
  "habit_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "date": "2026-04-23",
  "state": "DONE",
  "source": "API"
}
```

_Response (200 OK):_

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "log_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "habit_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "current_streak": 14,
    "best_streak": 21
  }
}
```

## 4. CLI Command Design

Built with `spf13/cobra` in Go for robust, discoverable subcommands.

- `habit init`
  - Creates `~/.config/devhabits/habits.db` (or OS equivalent) and applies the initial SQL schema.
- `habit add "Read 10 pages" [--frequency=daily]`
  - Creates a new habit.
- `habit done <habit_name_or_id> [--date=YYYY-MM-DD]`
  - Marks a habit as Done. Defaults to today. Can optionally pass yesterday's date if logging late.
- `habit skip <habit_name_or_id>`
  - Marks a habit as Skipped. Preserves the current streak.
- `habit status`
  - Prints a colored ASCII table showing today's tasks and their states (Pending, Done, Skipped).
- `habit web [--port=4224]`
  - Boots up the local HTTP server, exposes the API, and serves the embedded React dashboard at `http://localhost:4224`.

## 5. State Management Approach

**Frontend (React)**

1.  **Server State & Data Fetching:** **TanStack Query (React Query)**.
    - _Why?_ It handles caching, loading states, and background refetching automatically.
    - _Optimistic Updates:_ When a user clicks "Done" on the web UI, React Query instantly updates the local cache to show a checkmark (zero-lag UX) while making the `POST /api/logs` request in the background. If the network request fails, it rolls back the UI.
2.  **Local UI State:** **Zustand** (or React Context).
    - Used only for transient UI state that doesn't belong in the database (e.g., dark/light theme toggle, current selected sidebar tab, search bar text).

## 6. Local-First Data Strategy

To ensure data integrity when a user has the web dashboard running in the background while typing commands in their CLI, the database strategy must be robust.

1.  **Location:** The SQLite file is stored exclusively on the user's machine in their OS-specific config directory (e.g., `~/.config/devhabits/habits.db`).
2.  **Concurrency (The WAL Mode):**
    - SQLite locks the entire database on writes by default, which would cause "database is locked" errors if the CLI tries to write while the API is reading.
    - _Solution:_ We will execute `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` (Write-Ahead Logging) on initialization. WAL mode allows simultaneous readers and a writer, meaning the CLI can log a habit while the web server is actively polling or serving the dashboard.
3.  **Portability & Backup:**
    - Because it is local-first, backups are as simple as copying the `.db` file.
    - We will provide a `habit export` CLI command that dumps the SQLite data into a flat JSON file for easy version control via Git.
4.  **No-Setup Deployment:** By leveraging Go's `embed`, there is no `node_modules`, no Docker container, and no cloud service required. The user runs the binary, and the database and web server live entirely within that single process context.
