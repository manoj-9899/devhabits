  <h1>🚀 DevHabits</h1>
  <p><strong>The Developer-First Local Habit Tracker</strong></p>
  <p>
    DevHabits is a fast, local-first habit tracker built specifically for developers. It provides a seamless tracking experience by combining a powerful <b>Command Line Interface (CLI)</b> with a beautiful, modern <b>Web Dashboard</b>. By treating "Habits as Code," you can instantly log a habit in your terminal without breaking your coding flow, while keeping the Web Dashboard open for visual analytics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **💻 Dual Interface**: Manage your daily habits directly from the terminal or interact with the sleek web UI simultaneously — every change is instantly visible on both surfaces.
- **🔒 Local-First & Private**: All data is stored locally on your machine in a lightweight SQLite database. No cloud, no subscriptions, no tracking.
- **⚙️ Zero Database Configuration**: Works out of the box with zero external dependencies using Node.js native SQLite (`--experimental-sqlite`).
- **⚡ True Concurrency**: Powered by SQLite's WAL mode, the web dashboard and CLI interact with your data concurrently without locking or lagging.
- **📈 Advanced Analytics**: Real-time streak tracking, GitHub-style heatmaps, weekday consistency bars, and per-habit "fingerprints" via the React dashboard.
- **🎯 Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+/` (`Cmd+/` on macOS) anywhere in the web app to fuzzy-search every action — navigation, new habit, archive — without lifting your hands.
- **⌨️ Keyboard-First UX**: Single-key navigation (`1`–`4`), quick actions (`N` to add, `D`/`S`/`M` to log on the Today page), and a built-in shortcuts dialog (`?`).
- **🖼 Interactive Terminal UI**: A full-screen TUI mode (`habit ui`) built with Ink — navigate with `j`/`k`, log with `d`/`s`/`m`, no typing habit names.
- **🌈 Rich CLI Visualizations**: Time-aware greetings, 7-day streak strips per habit, GitHub-style year heatmap (`habit year`), per-habit charts (`habit chart`), and milestone celebration banners on streak hits.
- **♿ Accessible by Design**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA landmarks, focus management, skip-to-content link, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support throughout the web app.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js (v22.5.0+)**: Critical requirement. The backend relies heavily on the new `--experimental-sqlite` feature.
- **Git**

### Installation (1 Minute Setup)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manoj-9899/devhabits.git
   cd devhabits
   ```

2. **Bootstrap**
   One command, cross-platform — verifies Node, installs everything, links the CLI, and runs a health check.
   ```bash
   npm run bootstrap
   ```
   > Calls `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` on Windows or `scripts/bootstrap.sh` on macOS/Linux.
   > Prefer manual? `npm run setup` is the install-and-link-only equivalent.

3. **Launch the Application**
   Start both the web dashboard and the backend API simultaneously:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   > The web dashboard is now running at **`http://localhost:5173`**.

### Maintenance commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run doctor` | Validate Node version, deps, CLI link, DB path, ports — with OS-specific fix hints. |
| `npm run db:where` | Print the location of the SQLite database. |
| `npm run db:reset` | Wipe all habits and logs (with confirmation). Add `-- --yes` to skip the prompt. |
| `npm run check` | Run lint + production build for the frontend. |
| `npm run cli:link` | Re-link the global `habit` command if PATH lost it. |

---

## 💻 CLI Usage

Because the setup script linked the command globally, you can run `habit` from any terminal window. Fuzzy name matching means you don't need to type full habit names.

### Daily ritual

```bash
habit                  # Today's dashboard (default command)
habit done read        # Mark a habit as DONE
habit skip water       # Skip without breaking the streak
habit miss workout     # Mark as missed (breaks streak)
```

### Visualizations

```bash
habit week                  # 7-day grid across all habits
habit year                  # GitHub-style 365-day activity heatmap
habit chart "Read 30 min"   # 30-day strip for a single habit
habit stats                 # All-time completion rate + streaks
```

### Interactive TUI

For a full-screen experience built with Ink, run:

```bash
habit ui
```

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `↓` · `k` / `↑` | Move selection |
| `d` / `s` / `m` | Log Done / Skipped / Missed for the selected habit |
| `r` | Refresh from disk (catches changes made via the web app) |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |

> **Tip:** On Windows, **Windows Terminal** (not the legacy `cmd.exe`) is recommended for full Unicode + emoji rendering. The CLI detects the legacy console and shows a hint.

## ⌨️ Web Dashboard Shortcuts

Open the web dashboard (`npm run dev` → <http://localhost:5173>) and try these:

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **`Ctrl+/`** (`Cmd+/`) | Open the **Command Palette** — fuzzy search any action |
| `?` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `N` | New habit |
| `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` | Jump to Dashboard / Today / Habits / Analytics |
| `[` | Toggle the sidebar |
| `D` / `S` / `M` | When a habit card is focused on Today, mark Done / Skip / Miss |
| `Esc` | Close any open dialog |

Updates made in the CLI reflect instantly in the dashboard, and vice versa.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js API server utilizing `--experimental-sqlite` for native, dependency-free database management. Express.js for routing.
- **Frontend**: React 19 SPA built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. Framer Motion for animation, Zustand for transient UI state, TanStack Query for server state with optimistic updates.
- **CLI Tool**: Commander.js + Chalk + cli-table3 for the static commands, **Ink** + **React** for the interactive `habit ui` TUI. The interactive layer is lazy-loaded so the rest of the CLI starts instantly.
- **Design System**: Custom primitives (`Card`, `Modal`, `Input`, `Select`, `SegmentedControl`, `Toaster`, etc.) plus a unified motion language and design tokens shared across the dashboard and the command palette.
